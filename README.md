TechnoJam Pre-Membership Tasks
Hello Colleagues,
Myself Aditya Sah,
Enrolled in Btech Cse (Ai&ML)
I have opted for the task from dsa level hard question no 1 which requires to code a program which finds prime numbers between two numbers entered by user.
Also I have also made a program which reverse a array
Talking about myself i am from icse board and hence done some coding in java in my high school.
it didn't took me much time to write this code. 
and yes the reason being joining this club is that it will help me achieve my goals of creating innovative tech solutions which i will find out later.
thanks for giving time,
have a great day!
